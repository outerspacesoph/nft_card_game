## Game Rules

‚≠êÔ∏èPLEASE USE FULL SCREEN ON YOUR BROWSER FOR THE BEST DISPLAY‚≠êÔ∏è

‚úÖ Each player starts with 10 Mana ‚ë©

-Your Mana and Health are located at the bottom of the screen

-Mana are the currency spent or gained when making moves within the game

-Defending never costs Mana, you will gain 3 Mana

-Attacking costs 3 Mana. Be careful! If your Mana is too low you won't be able to attack!

-Mana is separate from the health points

‚úÖ Each player also starts with 25 health-points üü©

-When you are attacked, your health points are deducted by the attack value on the opposing player's card

-If you defend an attack, your defense value is subtracted from the opposing players attack value

‚úÖ Cards are randomly generated every turn üÉè

-Attack & defense values on the cards are randomly generated

-Cards with the same defense and attack point will cancel each other out
